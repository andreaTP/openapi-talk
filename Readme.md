# This is not your father's OpenAPI

## Abstract

OpenAPI is the de-facto standard specification for writing highly interoperable, production ready REST APIs.

There are [several tools](https://apis.guru/awesome-openapi3/) that supports OpenAPI and enhance the experience of working with it.

In this talk we will use a full bag of shiny new tools for working, and quickly producing production-ready services.

- Designing API specs using API Designer
- Registering API specs to Service Registry
- Generating the boilerplate and implementing a Quarkus service using a Quarkus Extension
- Generating fully functional SDKs with Kiota to be used in front-end and CLIs
