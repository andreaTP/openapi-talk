# This is not your father's OpenAPI

## Abstract

OpenAPI is the de-facto standard specification for writing highly interoperable, production-ready REST APIs.

With contract-first development, you can write a language-agnostic specification first, and get most of the implementations generated for you.

In this talk we will go through all the steps: we will start from scratch and will end with delivering, almost hands-off, a production-ready service, leveraging state-of-the-art tooling, and writing as little code as necessary.

- Designing API specs using API Designer
- Registering API specs to a Service Registry
- Generating the boilerplate and implementing a Quarkus service using a Quarkus Extension
- Generating fully functional SDKs with Kiota to be used in front-end and CLIs
